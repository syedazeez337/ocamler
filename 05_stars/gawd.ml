(*
Key Concepts:
Nested Lists : A list can contain other lists as elements, creating a tree-like structure.
Recursive Traversal : To process nested lists, we need to recursively traverse both the top-level list and any sublists.
Base Case and Recursive Case for Nested Lists : The base case is often an atom (a non-list value), and the recursive case handles lists
*)

(* Flatten function takes a nested list and returns a single flat list containing all the atoms *)
